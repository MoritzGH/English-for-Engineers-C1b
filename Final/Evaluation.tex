\colchunk{The expected progress for this paper was mostly adhered to which can be seen in figure 1. \\
The specific dates are displayed in table 5.\\
Some self-imposed deadlines were exceeded, but never more than a week or than the appointed deadlines in class. Because those deadlines included buffer time, we never had any issues with late submissions. As a group we managed to dispense the workload equally for all team members. We met 5 times, which helped immensely to solve any difficulties or questions.}
